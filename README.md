Food Product Explorer is a responsive React.js web application that allows users to search and explore food items using the OpenFoodFacts API. It includes features such as product search by name or barcode, category-based filtering, alphabetical sorting (A–Z, Z–A), and a detailed product view showing ingredients, nutrition, and labels. The app uses TailwindCSS for styling, supports pagination via a “Load More” button, and is built with clean, modular code for easy scalability.
